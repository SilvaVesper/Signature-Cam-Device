# Signature-Cam-Device

The goal of this project was to create a device that would allow the user to initial a document using a cam-driven mechanism. The code portion attached took a .png input of the user's 3-letter initial and was able to generate an X, Y, and Z cam shape that could be 3D printed and placed in the mechanism. 

Criterion for the .png input:
- The .png image has to be 192 x 96 pixels to be able to scale it. 
- The letters also have to be relatively connected/ no vast breaks in the curvature. (I.e. having a T as two separate sticks or a lowercase i)

This project was assigned for a Machine Design I course. The following code is in the same state of completion it was at the submission date.
